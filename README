This repository contains the code and data for the contact study carried out in
Nha Trang, the results of which are described in the manuscript:
“Pneumococcal exposure routes for infants, a nested cross-sectional survey in Nha Trang, Vietnam.”

Included in the repository are the following:

1.	Data files:

a.	df_contacts_public.csv
This is a csv file that contains relevant information about the reported contacts of the infants enrolled in the contact study. The columns contain: 
-	a serial number for each contact (contact_serial_no), a serial number for each infant (infant_serial_no), 
-	the age, in years, of each contact (contact_age) 
-	the contact time (contact_time). Specifically, the contact_time column states whether the contact was reported to be of short (under 5 minutes, contact_time=1), medium (between 5 minutes to 1 hour, contact_time=2) or long (over 1 hour, contact_time=3) duration 

b.	df_infants_public.csv
This csv file contains relevant information about the infants themselves. The columns contain: 
-	a serial number for each infant (infant_serial_no), which matches that found in df_contacts_public.csv
-	the age of the infant in months (infant_age)
-	a number – either 0 or 1 – in infant_pneumo_status, signifying whether the infant is a pneumococcal carrier (1) or is not (0).
-	an ID number representing the commune to which the infant belongs (commune_id)


c.	CarriageDataCarlaHalfYear.csv
This is a csv file that converts Table 6.1 from Carla Talarico’s thesis (page 179, available online: https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/64706) into line data. This is required for reproducing Figure 2 in the manuscript.


2.	Code:

a.	NhaTrangContactStudyCode.r
This is the main R file. Running this produces the p-spline fit to age, calculates PEI values for each infant, and then, using JAGS, performs the Bayesian logistic regression described in the paper.
It also reproduces Figures 2 and 3 in the manuscript. 

b.	spline_model.r
This is an R file that defines the p-spline (described by Eilers and Marx, 1996) required for the spline fit of pneumococcal carriage data to age.
